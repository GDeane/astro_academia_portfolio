        I focus my research on the intersection of AI, MultiAgent systems, and Game Theory. In particular, I am interested in
        what we can learn about cognition and Theory of Mind through studying how AI agents interact with one another and humans.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        I believe this is a promising path to move towards AI alignment, safety, and effective agentic systems.
